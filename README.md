# Career Ladders

Site is here: [Career Ladders Site](https://career-ladders.dev/)

[I have an article about how I put these into practice in case it's helpful.](https://css-tricks.com/the-importance-of-career-laddering/) It's very important to not just put up career ladders and call it a day, but rather, put them into practice with a system that your employees can trust.

It's been more than a year since [I promised Sam Julien](https://twitter.com/samjulien/status/1265713280095531008?s=20) that I would open source the career laddering I've developed as an Engineering Manager and VP. The purpose of open sourcing them is _not_ to give the impression that this is the one true way to do career laddering, or that these are perfect and there's nothing to improve upon here. There is some value in sharing them, though, in that many folks have mentioned to me that they don't know where to start.

I'm open sourcing my career ladders so that people have a launching-off point. I do not have this all figured out, please feel free to iterate, or give feedback, or submit a PR. Full transparency, I don't have a ton of time for maintenance right now, and am maintaining a _lot_ of repos, so if your PR goes unnoticed for a while, that's why. I also may reject a PR if it's not the way I personally want to structure something, but that's ok! It's alright for us to have different ways of creating laddering, in fact, I would encourage one to make some changes depending on your org in particular, we don't have to all be the same, and probably shouldn't be.

Special thanks to Lauren Sell, Dizzy Smith, Jason Lengstorf, and Dalia Havens for always being around to bounce my ideas off of. Thanks to Chad Fowler for demonstrating a great example of career laddering while I was at Microsoft!
