      It's very important to not just put up career ladders and call it a day,
      but rather, put them into practice with a system that your employees can
      trust.

    <p>
      I'm open sourcing my career ladders so that people have a launching-off
      point. I do not have this all figured out, please feel free to iterate, or
      give feedback, or submit a PR. Full transparency, I don't have a ton of
      time for maintenance right now, and am maintaining a
      <span class="italic">lot</span> of repos, so if your PR goes unnoticed for
      a while, that's why. I also may reject a PR if it's not the way I
      personally want to structure something, but that's ok! It's alright for us
      to have different ways of creating laddering, in fact, I would encourage
      one to make some changes depending on your org in particular, we don't
      have to all be the same, and probably shouldn't be.

      Special thanks to Lauren Sell, Dizzy Smith, Jason Lengstorf, and Dalia
      Havens for always being around to bounce my ideas off of. Thanks to Chad
      Fowler for demonstrating a great example of career laddering while I was
      at Microsoft!
