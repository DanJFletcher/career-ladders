      It's been more than a year since
      <a

        >I promised Sam Julien</a
      >
      that I would open source the career laddering I've developed as an
      Engineering Manager and VP. The purpose of open sourcing them is
      <strong>not</strong>
      to give impression that this is the one true way to do career laddering,
      or that these are perfect and there's nothing to improve upon here. There
      is some value in sharing them, though, in that many folks have mentioned
      to me that they don't know where to start.

        >I have an article about how I put these into practice coming out
        soon!</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm open sourcing my career ladders so that people have a launching-off
      point. I do not have this all figured out, please feel free to iterate, or
      give feedback, or submit a PR. Full transparency, I don't have a ton of
      time for maintenance right now, and am maintaining a
      <span class="italic">lot</span> of repos, so if your PR goes unnoticed for
      a while, that's why. I also may reject a PR if it's not the way I
      personally want to structure something, but that's ok! It's alright for us
      to have different ways of creating laddering, in fact, I would encourage
      one to make some changes depending on your org in particular, we don't
      have to all be the same, and probably shouldn't be.

      Special thanks to Lauren Sell, Dizzy Smith, Jason Lengstorf, and Dalia
      Havens for always being around to bounce my ideas off of. Thanks to Chad
      Fowler for showing me the first great example of career laddering!
